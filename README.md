# Sales Forecast Model

This project is a machine learning model built using **ML.NET** for predicting future sales. The model is trained with data from the first 12 months of sales for multiple companies that has been simulated not real comapnies and uses features such as:

- **Number of Employees**
- **Marketing Budget**
- **Industry Type**
- **Historical Sales**

After training, the model predicts the **Projected Sales** for the 13th month for each company based on these features.

## Key Features

- **Data-Driven Prediction**: Utilizes historical data from months 1â€“12 to predict sales for the 13th month.
- **ML.NET Integration**: Demonstrates the use of ML.NET for building and training a regression model.
- **Automated Sales Forecasting**: Generates future sales forecasts for companies across various industries.

This project showcases the power of machine learning to create accurate sales forecasts, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.
